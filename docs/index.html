<h1>Demystifying the TLC5940</h1>
<h2>A free book/library by Matthew T. Pandina</h2>

<p><a href="DemystifyingtheTLC5940.pdf">This book</a> explains how to turn the datasheet and application notes
for the Texas Instruments TLC5940, a 16 channel LED driver with dot
correction and grayscale PWM control, into an unencumbered C library
for use with an AVR microcontroller. This library uses the CLKO pin of
the AVR to drive the GSCLK line of the TLC5940, which allows grayscale
values to be updated at 3906.25 Hz with a CLK<sub>I/O</sub> of 16 MHz,
and 4882.8125 Hz with a CLK<sub>I/O</sub> of 20 MHz.</p>
